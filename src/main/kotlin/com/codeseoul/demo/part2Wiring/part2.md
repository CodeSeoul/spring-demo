### What is wiring?

- In the context of Spring Boot, wiring refers to the process of connecting components, beans, or dependencies in the
  application.
- Wiring ensures that the appropriate objects are instantiated and made available where they are needed, enabling
  dependency injection.
- This process can be done explicitly (manual wiring) or automatically (autowiring).
